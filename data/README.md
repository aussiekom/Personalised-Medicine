**The data comes in 4 different files. Two csv files and two text files:**

* training/test variants: These are csv catalogues of the gene mutations together with the target value Class, which is the (manually) classified assessment of the mutation. The feature variables are Gene, the specific gene where the mutation took place, and Variation, the nature of the mutation. The test data of course doesnâ€™t have the Class values. This is what we have to predict. These two files each are linked through an ID variable to another file each, namely:

* training/test text: Those contain an extensive description of the evidence that was used (by experts) to manually label the mutation classes.
